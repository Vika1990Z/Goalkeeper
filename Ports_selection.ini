    19.1 Description
        NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) — протокол для работы в локальных сетях на персональных ЭВМ типа IBM/PC. Разрешение имени NetBIOS — это процесс определения IP-адреса по имени NetBIOS.
        NetBIOS defines a software interface and a naming convention. NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP provides the NetBIOS programming interface over the TCP/IP protocol. 
        NetBIOS includes a name service, often called WINS on Microsoft Windows operating systems. The NetBIOS name service uses port 137/udp.

        The NetBIOS name service is only needed within local networks and with systems before Microsoft Windows 2000 which require name resolution through WINS. 
        Otherwise, in particular on the Internet, name resolution is done via DNS. Thus, it does not make sense to expose a NetBIOS name service to the Internet.
    19.2 Problem
        Openly accessible NetBIOS name services can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties. 
        Furthermore, they allow potential attackers to gather information on the server or network for preparation of further attacks.    
    19.3 Solution
        If NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP is not needed, disable it. Otherwise, restrict access to the NetBIOS name service to trusted clients, 
        e. g. by blocking incoming connections to port 137 tcp/udp on the firewall. 
        For security reasons, you should consider blocking access to ports 135, 138, 139 and 445 from anywhere on the Internet as well.
        On Linux/Unix systems, the NetBIOS name service is usually provided by 'nmbd' included with Samba. 
        If you don''t need Samba, disable or deinstall it. Otherwise, NetBIOS support can be disabled by setting: (disable netbios = Yes) in the Samba configuration.
